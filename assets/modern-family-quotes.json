And now I am very pleased to raise a glass and introduce for the first time ever, on our fourth try, great husbands, Mitch and Cam."

But that's when you find out there are two types of people: those who waste time staring at a closed door and those who find a window. I'm looking at my first month ever without a sale. Some people might give up. But those people aren't Phil Dunphy. It's like I tell my kids: keep a positive attitude and things will fall your way. As my favorite redhead once sang, the sun will come out tomorrow. That redhead, of course, was Mitchell, introducing me to the plucky orphan Annie, whose never-say-die attitude pulled this country out of a little thing called The Great Depression. And anything a little girl can do, I can try to do, too."
